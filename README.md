# About Me

-  I’m currently working on creating a personal website and a discord bot for my DND campaign.
-  I’m currently learning everything! I'm a beginner to CS, so every day is an oppurtunity for me to learn something new.
-  Ask me about anything! I'm always looking to meet new people.
-  To get in contact email me at: isabellerobbins44@gmail.com
-  My pronouns are She/Her
-  Fun facts: I have a cat named Scraggles whom I adore and spoil. I love doing archery, which I like to think prepares me well for a Zombie apocolypse.
